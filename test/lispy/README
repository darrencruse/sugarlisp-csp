These sugarlisp examples did work at one time but not anymore.

They probably stopped working when I incorporated more paren-free syntax handling here in csp.

For now I'm just going to say csp assumes use of SugarScript syntax (as opposed to SugarLisp).

I'm sure this would be easy to change if there's a desire for lispy syntax support.

If so please contact me at darren.cruse@gmail.com.
